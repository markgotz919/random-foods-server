3)This was the first time I have ever had to plan out the back end of a website.  I thought it was a pretty cool process, and I would like to try a more challenging project with additional tables.  

I liked learning about the model view controller and the rails application framework including the different parts, like routers, controllers, schema, models

It was confusting keeping track of the names of the tables, and columns, and a lot of times if things were not working it was because a column name missing an (s) or forgetting there was a under score in the name.  

I also wasn't sure if I should create a seperate table for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), or make one table and include a boolean for the type of meal.  I went with the later option because it seemed better to have less tables unless necessary.

4) FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS-

I would like users to be able to add different lists, like desserts, etc.
